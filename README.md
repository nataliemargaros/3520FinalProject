# 3520FinalProject
The code and files we used to process HST spectral data of the Martian atmosphere to determine whether or not Martian water loss is dependent on season. 

FULL DESCRIPTION: 
For our ASTR3520 course project at the University of Colorado Boulder, we used HST data collected by Dr. Dolon Bhattacharyya to determine if Martian water loss changes seasonally. In order to counteract any bias in our data collection and analysis, we subtracted Earth's H-alpha line, background sources (sky data), and orders of higher or lower spectral magnitude. In order to elimiate bias due to the day cycle on Mars, we plotted solar flux and scaled all counts to one day. This effectively eliminated variations due to solar activity and Mars -> Sun distance.
